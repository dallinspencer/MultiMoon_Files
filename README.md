# getHorizonsData
 A Code for Pulling Data from JPL Horizons

There are two functions you can use in this python code.

makeHorFile(objectName)
 This function accepts a string of an object's name or ID, and outputs a csv file in the same file/repo
 as the code. 
 
geoToKBOTime(fileName)
 This function accepts an object name, which has a geocentric csv file in the same directory, and converts that CSV's data into KBO centric 
 time.
